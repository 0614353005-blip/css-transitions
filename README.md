# css-transition

## Learning Target
- I am learning how to use the CSS ```position``` property to control how elements are positioned

## Success Criteria
- I can set ```position``` to ```absolute```, ```relative```, ```fixed```, and ```sticky```
- I can identify the differences between ```static```, ```absolute```, ```relative```, ```fixed```, and ```sticky```
- I can use ```top```, ```left```, ```bottom```, and ```right``` with ```position``` properties to position an element
